# Data Types in Python

## Learning Goals
- Explain variables and data types in Python
- Summarize the use of objects in Python
- Create a data structure for your Recipe app

## Task
- I decided to create a structure for each recipe as a dictionary. This will allow key-value pairs for speciifc name, cooking time and ingredients. This allows values to be of any data type, even another dictionary if needed. This flexibility will be useful for creating more complex structure if needed in the future.

- For holding all recipes I choose to create a list. A list is mutable. This enables easy manipulation of data.
